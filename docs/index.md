# Getting Started with Zinc

Welcome to the Zinc programming language! This documentation will guide you through the basics of writing and running Zinc programs.

## Installation

Before you can start using Zinc, you'll need to install the Zinc interpreter. You can download the interpreter from [Zinc's official website](https://zinc-lang.com/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Hello, Zinc!

Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" example. Create a new file with the ".zc" extension, e.g., `hello.zc`, and add the following code:

```zinc
main() {
    println("Hello, Zinc!");
}
```

Save the file and open your terminal. Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello.zc` and run the following command to execute the Zinc program:

```bash
zinc hello.zc
```

You should see the following output:

```
Hello, Zinc!
```

Congratulations! You've just run your first Zinc program.

## Variables

Zinc supports variables for storing and manipulating data. Here's an example of declaring and using variables:

```zinc
main() {
    let name = "Alice";
    let age = 30;
    
    println("Name: " + name);
    println("Age: " + age);
}
```

In this example, we've defined two variables, `name` and `age`, and printed their values.

## Functions

Functions allow you to organize your code into reusable blocks. Here's how you can define and call a function in Zinc:

```zinc
// Define a function
fn greet(name) {
    println("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

main() {
    // Call the function
    greet("Bob");
    greet("Alice");
}
```

This code defines a `greet` function that takes a `name` parameter and prints a greeting.

## Loops

You can use loops to repeat code multiple times. Here's an example of a loop in Zinc:

```zinc
main() {
    loop(5) {
        println("Hello, Zinc!");
    }
}
```

In this code, we use the `loop` function to print "Hello, Zinc!" five times.

## Input

You can get input from the user using the `input` function. Here's how it works:

```zinc
main() {
    let name = input("Enter your name: ");
    println("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

The `input` function prompts the user to enter their name and stores the input in the `name` variable.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a brief introduction to the Zinc programming language. You can explore more advanced features and libraries in the official Zinc documentation.

Happy coding with Zinc!
