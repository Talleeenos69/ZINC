# ZINC
Zero-cost INtegrated C++
--------------------------------------------------------

ZINC is a programming language written in C++ and C and aims to provide the same (if not more) functionality of these languages, but is easier to understand and a lot quicker to develop.

ZINC is for Linux/UNIX systems, but a windows port is planned. ZINC uses the ncurses library, and makes it a lot easier to use. 

C or C++ libraries are compatable with ZINC, however can only be programmed using their native syntax.
